            My programming journey began with Java, as it was the first
            programming language my school taught us in the academic year 2024 -
            2025. I spent hours in NetBeans IDE writing my first lines of code.
            I figured out how loops worked, debugged errors, and understood
            basic concepts like classes and inheritance. There were times when
            my code refused to run, but most of the time, I was able to find
            solutions.<br />
            <br />
            I also tried Python in VS Code. For me, Python is more readable than
            Java. Python felt more flexible and less wordy. I also took a small
            step into web development. I relearned parts of HTML and CSS. I
            loved building simple web pages and styling them. <br />
            <br />
            Additionally, I studied the surface of FFmpeg. I experimented with
            basic video and audio processing commands. I explored AutoHotkey for
            automating simple tasks on Windows and edited scripts to use in an
            online game.<br /><br />
            Beyond programming, I got interested in cryptocurrency and the
            technology behind it. I explored blockchain concepts and I learned
            how transactions work. <br />
            <br />
            I am excited to keep growing as a developer. <br /><br />
            The best part? <br />
            <br />
            This is only the beginning.
