              My programming journey began with Java for it is the first
              programming language that my school teaches us. I spent hours in
              NetBeans IDE writing my first lines of code. I figured out how
              loops worked, debugging errors, and understand basic concepts like
              classes and inheritance. There were times when my code refused to
              run but most of the time, I was able to find solutions for it. I
              also tried Python in VS Code. For me, Python is more readable than
              Java. Python felt more flexible and less wordy. I also took a
              small step into web development. I relearned parts of HTML and
              CSS. I loved building simple web pages and styling them. Beyond
              programming, I got interested in cryptocurrency and the technology
              behind it. I explored blockchain concepts and I learned how
              transactions work. I am excited to keep growing as a developer.
              The best part? This is only the beginning.
